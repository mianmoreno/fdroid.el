=fdroid.el= is an Emacs interface to [[https://f-droid.org/][F-Droid]]. Its purpose is to aid the management of F-Droid repository packages to be installed in an Android device from the comfort of Emacs.

To install it, simply put the =fdroid.el= file in your =load-path=, or optionally manually download the source and point to it.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/source/fdroid.el")
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can use the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager to install the current Git checkout for the package via the provided file =emacs-fdroid.scm=. Simply run the following command in the project's root.

#+begin_src sh
guix package --install-from-file=./emacs-fdroid.scm
#+end_src

This package makes use of the [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] and [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] packages to provide a more coherent interface to the interactive commands, so ensure these are installed too. An example configuration might look like what follows.

#+begin_src elisp
(fdroid-default-keybindings)
(with-eval-after-load 'fdroid
  (custom-set-variables
   '(fdroid-log-events t) ; Whether messages should be logged after an operation
   '(fdroid-program (executable-find "fdroidcl")))) ; Path to `fdroidcl'
#+end_src

In the above configuration, we set the default keybindings for the =fdroid-map= and from here on we can use the =fdroid-list-packages= (~C-c C-- l~) command to show all packages available for the current F-Droid repository. We can then invoke the following Embark actions on the targets:

- ~i~ :: install the current package.
- ~u~ :: uninstall the current package.
- ~d~ :: download the current package.
- ~s~ :: show more information about the current package.
