* fdroid.el
=fdroid.el= is an Emacs interface to [[https://f-droid.org/][F-Droid]]. Its purpose is to aid the management of F-Droid repository packages to be installed in an Android device from the comfort of Emacs.

To install it manually, simply point to the =fdroid.el= Git checkout in your =load-path=.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/fdroid.el")
#+end_src

If you'd like to contribute to the project, the easiest way is for you to install the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and start developing on it by invoking the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
cd /path/to/fdroid.el
guix shell --pure
#+end_src

Since this package leverages the [[https://github.com/mvdan/fdroidcl][fdroidcl]] F-Droid desktop client for most of its functionality, it's necessary for you to have it installed. If it's your first time using =fdroidcl=, ensure to download the F-Droid repository index via the =fdroid-update= command.

An example configuration might look like this:

#+begin_src elisp
(fdroid-default-keybindings)
(with-eval-after-load 'fdroid
  (custom-set-variables
   '(fdroid-log-events t) ; Whether messages should be logged after an operation
   '(fdroid-sans-device t))) ; Perform `fdroid-*' operations without a connected device
#+end_src

Above, we set the default keybindings for the =fdroid-map=, meaning from here on we can use the =fdroid-list-packages= (~C-c C-- l~) command to show all packages available for the current F-Droid repository. You can then invoke the interactive commands set below or, if you have the [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] package installed, the following Embark actions on the mini-buffer targets:

- =fdroid-install= (~i~) :: install the current package.
- =fdroid-uninstall= (~u~) :: uninstall the current package.
- =fdroid-download= (~d~) :: download the current package.
- =fdroid-show= (~s~) :: show more information about the current package.

You can use the project's [[https://lists.sr.ht/~conses/fdroid.el][mailing list]] to send feedback, patches or open discussions. Bugs should be reported on the project's [[https://todo.sr.ht/~conses/fdroid.el][bug-tracker]].
